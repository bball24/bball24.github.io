	<h2> About Me </h2>

	<p> Greetings! My name is Jerry Tan and I am a undergraduate computer science student from the University of California, Riverside. I am projected to finish my undergradate studies on June 2020, with a possibility of going to graduate school as part of the 5 year BS + MS computer science program.  I am mainly interested in full stack web development, with more experience with front end development. In my free time, I like to play basketball, watch NBA games, play Smash Bros, and learn new technologies. If you would chat with me about potential opportunities, feel free to email <a href='mailto:jerry88tan@gmail.com'>me</a>.</p>
